'I wanted an anti-racist approach to it.  Because the problem is not a black problem.  It's not my culture, not my religion that is the problem.  It is the racism of the white institutions.'  To go about proving that his anti-racist perspective would be more useful, he had to do a bit of research... He had to demonstrate that there was an already existing racist bias in the college's new recruits.  'As part of my research, I might have found that none of the cadets had a racist bias, maybe just a couple, so it's not a problem, so I'll do the multicultural course.'
