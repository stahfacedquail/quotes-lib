This enmeshment serves two functions: it distracts from racialised exclusion and incentivises Black compliance.  Prior to 1994, resistance to apartheid was justifiable from the perspective of both self-interest and social interest.
   Today, self-interest and social interest diverge, as Black South Africans are increasingly torn between contradictory desires for spectacular wealth and revolutionary equality.",

   Courtney replied that seeing as Yazz is the daughter of a professor and a very well-known theatre director, she's hardly underprivileged herself, whereas she, Courtney, comes from a really poor community where it's normal to be working in a factory at sixteen and have your first child as a single mother at seventeen, and that her father's farm is effectively owned by the bank
   yes but I'm black, Courts, which makes me more oppressed than anyone who isn't, except Waris who is the most oppressed of all of them (although don't tell her that)
   in five categories: black, Muslim, female, poor, hijabbed
   she's the only one Yazz can't tell to check her privilege
   Courtney replied that Roxane Gay warned against the idea of playing 'privilege Olympics' and wrote in Bad Feminist that privilege is relative and contextual, and I agree, Yazz, I mean, where does it all end?  is Obama less privileged than a white hillbilly growing up in a trailer park with a junkie single mother and a jailbird father?  is a severely disabled person more privileged than a Syrian asylum-seeker who's been tortured?  Roxane argues that we have to find a new discourse for discussing inequality.",
